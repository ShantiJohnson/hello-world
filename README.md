This is my ReadMe class Homework.

Hello Everyone!

My name is Peace Peace!

It's actually Shanti Irie Johnson, however 
Shanti ==='Peace in Sanskrit' & Irie === 'Peace in Jamaican'!

I am a quiet person with a LOUD personality!  I am easy going and love a good challenge....this makes puzzles something I thoroughly enjoy.  I decided to take up coding to make a great career move and also be challenged in my everyday life. I am excited to begin my journey with SavvyCoders and look forward to all the knowledge I will acquire.
